# My Portfolio

## Introduction
Welcome to my portfolio project! In this project, I've created a single-page portfolio website to showcase my work and skills. This portfolio is built using React.js and utilizes various libraries and tools to create a polished and professional-looking page.

## Project Overview
This portfolio consists of several sections, each serving a specific purpose:

1. **Header**: The header contains external links to my social media accounts and internal links to other sections of the page, allowing easy navigation.

2. **Landing Section**: The landing section features an avatar picture and a brief bio, providing visitors with an introduction to who I am and what I do.

3. **Projects Section**: In this section, I display my featured projects as cards in a grid fashion, highlighting my skills and accomplishments.

4. **Contact Me Section**: The contact me section includes a form that allows visitors to contact me directly. This form is implemented using Formik and Yup for form validation.

## Libraries Used
- **Chakra UI**: Chakra UI is used for styling components throughout the project. It provides pre-configured UI components that help create a consistent and visually appealing design.
